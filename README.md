# Raylib Text-Editor: 
Text editor programmed in C language. I kept the style with a default raylib look cuz it looked like an old macintosh program, it fits that "c vibe" ig lol.

## Libraries:
- Raylib + RayGUI
- Simple Dynamic Strings

## Installation:
- Run the main.exe file directly.
- You can also compile the project yourself by opening it in VS Code.
